# Build-Your-Own-ML
This repository is for the Jupyter Notebooks where I am building my own Machine Learning models. The idea is to have a great understanding of the models over and above using in built packages.
So far it includes linear regression, logistic regression, K nearest neighbours, naive bayes classifier and decision tree.
